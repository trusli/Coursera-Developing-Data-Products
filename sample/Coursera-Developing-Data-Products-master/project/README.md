Developing Data Products Project - LEGO Sets Visualization  
==========================================================

This Shiny App is for searching and visulizating LEGO Sets information.    
The dataset is from [Rebrickable.com](http://rebrickable.com/) that contains the basic information of each set (set id, year, number of pieces, theme, set name).  
Data Source: http://rebrickable.com/downloads  
**Note**: Since I didn't use the API to collect data, the current data might not be 100% accurate.  

The project is on Shiny User Showcase page (Shiny Apps with popular appeal): https://gallery.shinyapps.io/lego-viz.
It can also be found here: https://xiaodan.shinyapps.io/LegoSetViz.
